Welcome to TORCS
----------------
First a big welcome, I hope you will enjoy your ride:-) Do not forget to look
into the TORCS program menu, it contains very interesting things (e.g. a link
to the online track generator, track editor, documentation, etc.).

Kind regards

Bernhard

1. Licenses
-----------
Not the whole TORCS distribution content has the same license. Non free in the
GPL or Free Art License sense are:
- The cars in cars/kc-* and cars/pw-* directories, have a look at the specific
  readme.txt files in those directories (rally and classic cars).
- The stripe utility. It is free for noncommercial use and is included with
  permission form Steven Skiena. See http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~stripe for
  details. It is used by the accc tool. The accc tool is used for creating
  cars and advanced tracks.

2. TORCS Requirements
---------------------
You need at least a 600MHz CPU (800MHz recommended), 128 MB RAM (256MB
recommended) and an OpenGL 1.3 capable graphics card with 32MB RAM (64MB
recommended). Make sure that you have installed the latest sound and
graphics drivers.

3. Running TORCS
----------------
- Read the "How-To Drive" on www.torcs.org
  (http://torcs.sourceforge.net/index.php?name=Sections&op=viewarticle&artid=10).
- Press F1 anytime to get help (do it as well during the ride to learn about
  the options).
- Read the FAQ to learn about split screen multiplayer and more.
- Or watch videos, you find the links on www.torcs.org

4. Getting Help
---------------
First have a look at the available documentation on www.torcs.org and
www.berniw.org. If you find no solution for the problem learn in the
FAQ how and where to report a problem. The best place to get help is the
torcs-users mailing list, you find the link on www.torcs.org.

5. Car Setups
-------------
Since 1.3.5 there is a car setup screen integrated in TORCS, if you run
a practice or qualifying session as human player you can hit the "esc"
(escape) key, then choose in the menu "setup car, restart", or if the
track has a pit, make a pit stop and hit there the "setup" button. Your
setups are stored then in "drivers/human/*.xml". For some information
about the properties look into the robot tutorial chapter 5
(http://www.berniw.org/tutorials/robot/ch5/properties.html).

6. Creating Tracks
------------------
The track editor is included in the TORCS distribution for Windows. It
is automatically installed if you select to install the "Trackeditor and Tools".
Alternatively you can get it from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/trackeditor or
http://www.berniw.org/trb/download/trackeditor-0.6.2c.tar.bz2.
The sources are included in the jars.

7. Robot (AI driver) programming
--------------------------------
You find a robot programming tutorial on www.berniw.org in the TORCS section.
Have a look at the FAQ as well.
